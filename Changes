 - Initialize user options by calling a lexical subroutine.

 - Replace calls to not existant copyTree/splitTextNode subs
   with calls to the copy/split methods.

 - Populate the config data hashes with true values at runtime.

 - Remove the superfluous use of 'defined' when checking booleans.

 - Declare globals with 'our' instead of 'use vars'.

 - Assign the config data at once within the parser object.

 - Set initial version numbers for the Node, Parser and Tree class.

0.9_02 Sun Aug 16 12:31:18 CEST 2009

   [rt #48538 - Jesse S. Bangs]

0.9_01 Wed Aug 12 14:25:08 CEST 2009

0.9 Tue Apr 29 12:21:00 CEST 2008

 - Added support for dealing with starred commands.
   [James Bowlin <bowlin@mindspring.com>]

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.8_02 Thu Feb 21 21:08:50 CET 2008

 - Added further test-files to suite (i.e., ones that test the
   parser, tree and node functionality).

 - Fixed a slight documentation error (the method getTopLevelNodes()
   returns a list, and *not* an array reference).

0.8_01 Tue Feb 19 15:29:40 CET 2008

 - Added basic test-file basic.t.

 - Added CREDITS and LICENSE sections to the documentation.

0.8 Mon Oct  8 10:23:01 CEST 2007

 - Fixed failing tests pod.t & pod-coverage.t (adjusted plans).

0.7 Tue Aug 28 00:12:03 CEST 2007

 - Added formatting tags to the documentation where appropriate
   and enlisted all methods within the documentation index.

0.6 Wed Mar 14 01:05:09 CET 2007

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.5_05 Sun Feb 18 11:30:51 CET 2007

 - Fixing reference types in all ...->{children}->{nodes}->[...]
   occurrences in the LaTeX::TOM::Parser::_applyMapping and
   LaTeX::TOM::Node::getLastChild subroutines.
   [Otakar Smrz, otakar.smrz@mff.cuni.cz]

0.5_04 Fri Feb 16 10:41:21 CET 2007

 - Fixed approximately half a dozen broken hash keys in references
   with {node} instead of {nodes} as subkey.

0.5_03 Fri Feb 16 02:00:52 CET 2007

 - Fixed wrong spelling of $self->{node} to $self->{nodes} within
   LaTeX::TOM::Parser.

0.5_02 Mon Feb 12 03:37:11 CET 2007

 - Added suitable (albeit slightly modified) pod.t & pod-coverage.t
   to the test directory.

 - Documented LaTeX::TOM's constructor new().

0.5_01 Mon Feb  5 08:47:05 CET 2007

 - Resolved accidentally swapped $prev/$next pointers in assignment
   in LaTeX::TOM::Node's listify(), resulting in misbehaviour of
   getNextGroupNode(), getPreviousSibling() and the like.

 - Added fully qualified package declaration to LaTeX::TOM::Parser,
   LaTeX::TOM::Node & LaTeX::TOM::Tree. Removed class specification
   from sub declarations likewise.

 - LaTeX::TOM's constructor, new() reblesses a LaTeX::TOM::Parser
   object with the references to the global variables defined within
   LaTeX::TOM. @_ is passed unaltered to LaTeX::TOM::Parser's new().

 - LaTeX::TOM establishes an ISA relationship with LaTeX::TOM::Parser
   and LaTeX::TOM::Parser with LaTeX::TOM::Node/LaTeX::TOM::Tree.

 - LaTeX::TOM::Tree's constructor, new() now returns a blessed hash
   reference instead of previously a blessed array reference, because
   we're basically reblessing the $parser object.

 - Extracted the TODO part from LaTeX::TOM and put it in a separate
   file named TODO in the root of the distribution.

0.5 Son Dec 31 01:47:36 CET 2006

 - Percents (%) and braces ({}) within verbatim blocks
   are now taken care of while parsing.

 - Replaced all occurences of tabs within the code with
   literal whitespace.

0.3 Sun Dec 24 11:37:21 CET 2006 

 - Initial CPAN version.

02c ???

 - Bug fixes: Handling of newlines and whitespace between commands 
   and parameters and groups, handling of \w+\d+ commands (thanks 
   Leo Tenenblat for both of these), documentation bugfix: "parseFile",
   not "parsefile".

02b ???

 - License included (BSD), some minor code indenting cleanups.

02 ???

 - This is the first release version.

01 ???

 - Non-OOP version of the current functionality. Not released.
